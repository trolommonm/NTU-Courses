In fact, much of everyday life is regulated and dictated by environmental law and policy of one kind or another.This course aims to provide students with a good overview of Environmental Sustainability Law and the policies that move the enactment of these laws, regulations, and guidelines. Students will study these issues from an international and national perspective and will have an appreciation of the roles and limitations of the law in resolving these issues.As we all live, work and often play in the built (man-made) environment, this course will devote considerable time examining the way our built environment can be developed to enable a sustainable future.

Its deceptively simple core theme of \"development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs? is now central for business success. Achieving organizational sustainable development and operation involves the engagement with and management of the full range of stakeholders; including customer, shareholder, corporate, community, government and non-government. Geographical dimensions range from local to regional to International. Many organizations now accept sustainability as important to their mission and have strategized for this. Yet outcomes have been mixed, at best. Organizations struggle to align their business and sustainable objectives, something that critics including their customers and NGOs are quick to point out and often do so loudly to corporate detriment. This course focuses on the planning, development and management of sustainability as a central and integral component of successful business outcomes as undertaken in the Asia Pacific region. The course has an applied bias that brings the essence of sustainability theory into practical industry application where the perspectives of the different stakeholders are central to success as a clear understanding of the complexities of Asian contexts. No prior knowledge of the principles or application of sustainability is required, as this course will be delivered accordingly. Participants in this course will address large- and small-scale organizations in a variety of Asian contexts. Ways of thinking about these, the issues involved and the crafting of proactive strategies are relevant to a range of business contexts.

It is also relevant to us as consumers because we are exposed to hundreds of messages from marketers every day.This course is concerned with the development, implementation and evaluation of marketing communication activities.  The course primarily takes the marketer's perspective, requiring you to consider and critically evaluate factors influencing both the design and implementation of comprehensive, integrated marketing communication (IMC) programs.  In this course, we regard IMC as a system of thinking, processes and coordinated activities driven by the marketer's objectives. Adopting a global perspective, we draw illustrative examples and cases from different parts of the world and discuss issues faced by marketers in conducting IMC programs across countries. The course is designed to develop your logical thinking and creativity regarding IMC.  Although this course is oriented towards practice, we still cover theories and concepts that explain how marketing communication (marcom) practices work and their applicability.  Using these theories and concepts to analyse practices, you will be able to choose and design marcom activities judiciously, justify your choice, and appraise the effectiveness of the activities.Instead of treating IMC as a set of stand-alone tools or activities, the course regards it as a blended mix of coordinated activities.  The course put roughly equal emphasis on both traditional marcom tools (e.g., advertising and sales promotion) and non-traditional tools (e.g., search engine marketing and social media marketing).  The course compares the similarities and differences of these tools, and explains how they can work together for achieving the marketer's objectives.  While non-traditional marcom tools catch marketers' attention nowadays, traditional marcom tools are indispensable for particular purposes and under certain circumstances.

Cyber physical systems are characterized by stringent performance requirements, such as, extremely low energy budget, small area footprint and often hard real-time constraints. Due to the pervasive nature of the cyber physical systems in our everyday lives, it also runs the risk of huge security hazards.In this course, we will learn about the basics of cyber physical systems, including the design principles and methodologies. Further, there will be a detailed treatment of the security challenges for cyber physical systems, which vary in practice due to the diverse nature of the application environment of cyber physical systems. These different forms of security breaches, observed across diverse cyber physical systems, will be put in a well-characterized taxonomy, to be systematically identified as attack surfaces. The techniques to handle these attacks will be described in a generic manner, including key management and wireless/RFID communication. The attack surfaces and protection/mitigation principles will then be elaborated with practical case studies, from the representative cyber physical systems such as automotive, smart card systems and smart grid.

Cyber physical systems are characterized by stringent performance requirements, such as, extremely low energy budget, small area footprint and often hard real-time constraints. Due to the pervasive nature of the cyber physical systems in our everyday lives, it also runs the risk of huge security hazards.In this course, we will learn about the basics of cyber physical systems, including the design principles and methodologies. Further, there will be a detailed treatment of the security challenges for cyber physical systems, which vary in practice due to the diverse nature of the application environment of cyber physical systems. These different forms of security breaches, observed across diverse cyber physical systems, will be put in a well-characterized taxonomy, to be systematically identified as attack surfaces. The techniques to handle these attacks will be described in a generic manner, including key management and wireless/RFID communication. The attack surfaces and protection/mitigation principles will then be elaborated with practical case studies, from the representative cyber physical systems such as automotive, smart card systems and smart grid.

With the scientific discoveries of Isaac Newton and others in the late seventeenth century, Western civilization experienced an epistemological shift from an adherence to traditional structures of authority (church, crown, patriarchal family) to the age of empiricism and a privileging of reason, evidence, and experientially acquired knowledge espoused by such philosophers as John Locke. This crisis of authority (reason versus revelation, evidence versus faith), exacerbated by the political upheavals and constitutional debates in the wake of England's Civil Wars and the Glorious Revolution, sent shock waves through all levels of society, including the domestic. How did women-having few political rights, little financial independence, and existing as legal nonentities when married-respond to this new age of discovery? The title of the course is meant to indicate the binary opposition of \"good\" and \"bad\" women with which real, complex women had to work in order to survive in society. The course itself will problematize that opposition in an effort to understand how women in an uncertain but exciting age could form and articulate their voices-as images of God, as rational beings, as rejects and misfits, as companions, wives, mothers, and citizens-in an effort to contribute to the public and private spheres and establish their own dignity as members of society.

Since feminists have been at the forefront of questioning political and social norms, this course will examine the intellectual history of feminist thought, as well as the feminist `uses' of history.  It will take a `transnational' approach, not only comparing feminist movements in various parts of the world, but also examining the international networks forged by feminists and the manner in which transnational connections shaped local and national feminist movements.  The course begins by considering several historiographical questions, in particular, when did feminism `begin', what were its main periods or `waves' and what has constituted `feminism' historically?  We will then investigate the role of transnational connections, imperialism, nationalism, class and race in shaping nineteenth and early twentieth century feminism.

This course explores three important elements of the history of time: its intellectual conception and cultural representation; its scientific and technological quantification, rationalization, and mastery; and its role in structuring societies and their activities. First, over the course of history, different cultures have conceived of time in a variety of ways (e.g. circular, cyclical, progressive) and on many different scales (e.g. cosmic, geologic, civilizational, industrial). In turn, these cultural conceptions of time have given rise to different ideas about the relationship of individual human lives to societies, and societies to history as a whole. Second, the effort to quantify time has given rise to a distinct science and technology of time-keeping, from the ancient sun-dial to today?s atomic clock. Third, the consciousness and quantification of time has made possible numerous social institutions and practices, ranging from the invention of interest on debt to the modern state to the institution of wage-labor. Through discussions of secondary texts and primary sources (including films, art works, and literary texts) this course will explore the history of time as a critical element of human experience from antiquity to present.

Topics are organized functionally so as to maintain student focus on the relationship between form and function. The broader organization will first outline speech production, and then the processes of speech perception and the associated mechanisms of hearing will be discussed. Within each topic, the key elements of the musculoskeletal system are described first, and then the  physiological  principles governing their operation are covered. Because of the natural anatomical overlap across functional topics, each layer discussed will build on the last.The course will first cover the mechanism of respiration. Next, phonation, pitch, and laryngeal articulation (including protective maneuvers) will be introduced and  the relationship between laryngeal control and respiration will be elucidated. These components will be connected to the notion of the sound source (in acoustic theoretic terms). Students will be introduced to live demonstrations of low-dimensional biomechanical models of the vocal folds and the basic  elements of myoelastic- aerodynamic theory will be discussed. Laryngoscopy  and laryngeal ultrasound for speech and non-speech processes will also be used to support anatomical and physiological theory, and students will be required to know how to identify the laryngeal structures as observed with these instrumental techniques.The mechanism of the  supralaryngeal structures will then be discussed. This is a broad subject area and its subtopics include the jaw, the tongue and pharynx, the velopharyngeal port and nasal cavity, and the lips. A significant amount of attention will be given to the structure of the bones of the skull and their muscular connections. Each of these components will  be illustrated using biomechanical models developed in ArtiSynth to visually demonstrate to students the individual and joint effects of muscle action on the articulators. Students will be made aware of how this supralaryngeal component concerns the acoustic filter of the vocal tract and live demonstrations of articulatory  speech  synthesizers  (such  as  VocaiTractlab;  http://www.vocaltractlab.de/) will reinforce this principle. Students will also be exposed to speech imaging data in the form of MRI and lingual ultrasound. Students will be required to identify relevant vocal tract structures observable with these methods. Once the full mechanism is outlined, speech-related processes will be introduced with a focus on consonant and vowel production. The laryngeal components of these, such  as  voicing  and  aspiration,  will allow students to integrate what they learned about the larynx into the subject of supralaryngeal    articulation.   Students   will   gain   an   appreciation   of   the   complexorchestration involved in producing basic eve sequences and be required to producedetailed  descriptions  of  the  physiological  events  involved  such  sequences,  includingthose discussed in relation to the larynx. Students will also gain an appreciation of how the life-supporting functions of chewing and swallowing relate to speech. Some attentionwill also be given to the muscles of the lower face and their use in facial expression.The course will then focus on the perceptual side of speech and introduce the mechanism of hearing by examining, in turn, the outer, middle, and inner ear. Students will be taught about theories of aural sensation and be introduced to  some  of  the physical principles governing the hearing mechanism, including impedance transformation and the mechanoelectrical transduction processes of the hair cells. Some discussion will be given to the neural ear and how speech sounds become perceived by the brain.The students will be introduced briefly to the  anatomy of the brain and the  cranial nerves. The details of these topics will be related back to the preceding major sections of the course concerning speech production  and  perception by describing  (in light detail) the neural pathways involved in motor control of speech, including the topics of the reflex arc, muscle spindles, and proprioception, and those for the perception of (speech) sound.The final topic discussed will introduce the topic of ontogenetic development of the vocal tract structures. Development in general will be briefly described and the students will be introduced to some of the genetic mechanisms that guide this process (with the side effect of sowing an interest for a potential course about Language and Genetics). Students will then be given a short tour of the developing vocal tract. A final link will then be made to phylogenetic development of vocal  tract structures, with an equally short survey of the comparative morphology of structures found in other specifies that are homologous to those of the human vocal tract. Variation of vocal tract structures as a function of factors such as age, sex, and broad ethnic-background, will also  be noted and supported with irnaging data whenever possible.Key subjects covered include:1.\tusing  anatomical  and  physiological  terminology  to  describe  the  processes  ofspeech production and perception;2.\tthe relationship between the auditory categories of the IPA and the mechanismsof speech production;3.\tan  appreciation  of the  link  (and  sometimes  lack  thereof)  between  anatomical form and physiological function;4.\tan appreciation of the relationship between physical principles (such as acoustics or aerodynamics) and the processes of speech and hearing;5.\tpractice interpreting anatomical and speech-instrumentation  data."}, "HG8005": {"name": "GLOBAL LANGUAGES, LOCAL CULTURE", "au": "  3.0", "program": "LMS(SOH)", "mutually_exclusive": null, "not_available_to_program": null, "not_available_to_all_program_with": null, "not_available_as_core_to_program": null, "not_available_as_UE_to_program": null, "not_available_as_PE_to_program": null, "prerequisite": null, "grade_type": null, "description": "In this course you will learn about the development and spread of pluricentric world languages such as Arabic, Chinese, English, and Spanish that have been transported to many areas of the world, where they have established somewhat separate. developments.

The study of each type of loading is complemented by a large number of examples designed to strengthen the students' understanding of the subject.Topic 5 is devoted to the determination of shearing stresses in beams under transverse loadings. More advanced aspects of the design of beams, such as the determination of the principal stresses at the junction of the flange and web of a W-beam, are in Topic 6. The chapter also includes the determination of stresses under combined loadings that can now include the determination of the principal stresses, principal planes, and maximum shearing stress at a given point.The determination of the deflection of beams is discussed in Topic 7. The first part of the chapter is devoted to the integration method followed by the use of singularity functions. Topic 8 is devoted to columns and includes the design of steel and aluminum columns.

In order to be equipped with the essential knowledge and skills to design effective environments, they will learn how to consider the needs of diverse children (individual and group), the relevance of the learning contexts, the use of age-appropriate and open-ended resources, issues of safety (physical and psychological), and the interlocking roles of the teacher as the environmental designer and as the facilitator of the learning in the setting up of the environment. To highlight the importance of exploration and play-based learning, and authentic experiences for preschool or lower primary children, the employment of learning centres will be extensively explored as an important pedagogical approach for teachers in the preschool or lower primary specialization. A key idea here is that the learning environment can support children as the protagonists of their construction of knowledge and foster respectful relationships. The course will therefore provide participants with an understanding of the principles and roles of learning centers and how these can be thoughtfully integrated within the preschool or lower primary curriculum and class setups (indoor and outdoor).

With few exceptions, however, the tradition's canonical thinkers have seen this plurality as a condition that needs to be overcome, not as one to be affirmed. In this course we will study a variety of twentieth-century political theorists who have not only recognized the fact of human difference, but who argue that the realization of democracy depends upon precisely the affirmation of this difference.  Democracy is thus essentially related to the effort to give an expression to the multiplicity of social forms of doing, being, and thinking that internally differentiate all political societies. Students will be encouraged to contrast this understanding of democracy with those contemporary ones that emphasize the values of social harmony and consensus, providing them with a ground to critically probe actually existing political institutions and orders."}, "HA4017": {"name": "ECONOMIC ISSUES FOR PUBLIC DECISION MAKING", "au": "  4.0", "program": "PPGA(SSS)", "mutually_exclusive": null, "not_available_to_program": null, "not_available_to_all_program_with": null, "not_available_as_core_to_program": null, "not_available_as_UE_to_program": null, "not_available_as_PE_to_program": null, "prerequisite": "HA1003", "grade_type": null, "description": "This course introduces students to an in-depth examination of the forces that influence the behavior of public administrators engaged in the public sector decision-making process on economic issues.

In this module you will learn about the writings of thinkers who lived centuries ago, as well as important works by contemporary philosophers. It will become apparent that intelligent people can disagree about moral issues, and that no one person?s moral views are beyond criticism. However, careful study will reveal that some views concerning morality are more credible than others. The student?s task will be to evaluate the various perspectives and form a reasoned judgment as to how the central questions of the course should be answered. The questions to be considered include the following: ? How does one reason about morality? ? Can moral claims be objectively true? ? What is the morally right thing to do? And what makes it right? ?

In this course, we will read and discuss classical scholarship pieces on these topics in the context of how urban life relates to urban planning. A secondary dimension of the course is learning about the comparative lens in urban research, particularly as it pertains to comparing the experience of urban development in Western cities and the cities in Asia. Lastly, the course seeks to introduce you to the theory-practice nexus of urban planning as a discipline by interleaving discussions of theory with guest lectures about the professional practice of planning."}, "HU2003": {"name": "THE GEOGRAPHIES OF UNEVEN DEVELOPMENT", "au": "  3.0", "program": "SSS", "mutually_exclusive": null, "not_available_to_program": null, "not_available_to_all_program_with": null, "not_available_as_core_to_program": null, "not_available_as_UE_to_program": null, "not_available_as_PE_to_program": null, "prerequisite": null, "grade_type": null, "description": "This course examines themes, concepts, theories, and trends which define the study of international development from a critical geographical perspective. Students will gain an understanding of the historical and contemporary challenges of global inequality with reference to specific case studies. We shall be discussing what Development means by examining different development pathways and strategies throughout the global economy. While the course's main premise is economic development, we shall be reading more widely across the literature which strategically ties development to different scales -bodies, villages, cities, nations, across borders - to show that development is really not limited to the Global South but is vitally about (dis)connections and (im)mobilities in the global economy. This will also show that development is not disembodied but made up of and affects different people in very different ways. Case studies from around the world are used to provide empirical contexts to the theories we learn about international development practices, processes and problems."}, "HU2004": {"name": "BORDERS", "au": "  3.0", "program": "SSS", "mutually_exclusive": null, "not_available_to_program": null, "not_available_to_all_program_with": null, "not_available_as_core_to_program": null, "not_available_as_UE_to_program": null, "not_available_as_PE_to_program": null, "prerequisite": null, "grade_type": null, "description": "Borders and bordering processes are a fundamental field of study with human geography and adjacent fields of social science.
