In fact, much of everyday life is regulated and dictated by environmental law and policy of one kind or another.This course aims to provide students with a good overview of Environmental Sustainability Law and the policies that move the enactment of these laws, regulations, and guidelines. Students will study these issues from an international and national perspective and will have an appreciation of the roles and limitations of the law in resolving these issues.As we all live, work and often play in the built (man-made) environment, this course will devote considerable time examining the way our built environment can be developed to enable a sustainable future.

Its deceptively simple core theme of \"development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs? is now central for business success. Achieving organizational sustainable development and operation involves the engagement with and management of the full range of stakeholders; including customer, shareholder, corporate, community, government and non-government. Geographical dimensions range from local to regional to International. Many organizations now accept sustainability as important to their mission and have strategized for this. Yet outcomes have been mixed, at best. Organizations struggle to align their business and sustainable objectives, something that critics including their customers and NGOs are quick to point out and often do so loudly to corporate detriment. This course focuses on the planning, development and management of sustainability as a central and integral component of successful business outcomes as undertaken in the Asia Pacific region. The course has an applied bias that brings the essence of sustainability theory into practical industry application where the perspectives of the different stakeholders are central to success as a clear understanding of the complexities of Asian contexts. No prior knowledge of the principles or application of sustainability is required, as this course will be delivered accordingly. Participants in this course will address large- and small-scale organizations in a variety of Asian contexts. Ways of thinking about these, the issues involved and the crafting of proactive strategies are relevant to a range of business contexts.

You will also learn to apply basic concepts of curation with the editing, selection and presentation of images. The Role of the Photographer:Through analysis and discussions of a variety of images, you will be introduced to the semiotics of photography and the role of the photographer in its creation. The photographer as director/art director takes on the responsibility of meaning-making within the frame. Awareness will be brought to the ideas of the preconditioned gaze and the definition of the self in opposition to the other. This will translate to working with subjects and how best to engage and represent them in a photograph. Photography in the Digital Age of Social Media: Digital technology has made the photographic image more ubiquitous than ever. Lectures and discussions will touch upon photographic history and theory, as we try to locate the position of photography as an art form in the age of social media and the proliferation of the everyday image. Attempts will be made as a class to define distinguishing or overlapping traits between fine art and vernacular photography. Class Assignments:- Three creative projects of increasing difficulty help guide you along the process of developing a conceptual photography series. These projects are developed through lectures, tutorials, and instructor and peer feedback sessions. During guided group critiques of projects, you will learn to give structured feedback as you build a visual vocabulary and deepen your understanding of fine art photography. - To inform your own practice, you are to give an artist presentation and to write an exhibition review. This will allow you to research, analyse and present findings on the work of established fine-art photographers and artists who are leading the use of digital imaging.- In-class technical assignments help entrench lessons learnt during lectures and demonstrations.

In particular, it seeks to provide students with some insightful perspectives on how Asian companies can begin on their journeys to become global competitors. Asian companies must learn to adapt to the fast-changing rules of global competition, when many of these rules are enacted by the West. The recent sagas against Chinese companies on toys, milk products, textiles and other related products are examples for Asian companies to realize that they cannot operate independently of international opinions, norms, and sensitivities. Without a doubt, Asian companies must continue to improve their management and learn to strategize better to effectively deal with the West. They need to improve their global competitiveness, learn to build world-class businesses and brands, and how to establish sustainable global companies in order to rival the Western multi-national corporations.

Forward-looking corporations such as Barclays, Walmart, and Procter and Gamble, as well as governmental agencies in the United States and Singapore are now applying insights from the principles of behavioural decision science to guide the design of products and services and even policy. This course is specially designed to help students understand how humans (consumers, doctors, accountants, policy makers, managers, parents, and students themselves) make -good or bad- decisions. Ever since Daniel Kahneman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002, we have a more accurate understanding of the fact that people do not necessarily obey rational rules in making decisions. This does not mean that decisions are made randomly; on the contrary, an alternate set of rules is at play. Even though the human brain is capable of making millions of calculations per second, it cannot avoid the influences of these biases. Research in cognitive sciences, psychology, behavioural economics and decision neuroscience is guiding us to a fuller understanding of how decisions are made by people. Empowered with this knowledge, you (students) will not only improve your own decision making but also explore ways to design organizations that help people make better decisions. You will learn the decision-making processes and biases that impact choice behaviour. Examples include but not limited to: What are examples of irrational decision making and what are the reasons of this behavior? How do customers make their purchase choices? How do people decide to save (or not)? How do we persuade people to climb the stairs instead of using the elevator? How do our biology and brain influence our decision making? How does the environment influence our behaviour? How does the brain assess risk, trust, time? Overall, you will develop strategic awareness about the biases that could influence judgment and lead to suboptimal decisions."}, "BU9201": {"name": "INVESTMENTS", "au": "  3.0", "program": "BUS", "mutually_exclusive": "BF2201", "not_available_to_program": "ACBS, ACC, BUS", "not_available_to_program_with": null, "not_available_as_core_to_program": null, "not_available_as_UE_to_program": null, "not_available_as_PE_to_program": null, "prerequisite": "BU8201 (Min Grade :B+) ", "grade_type": null, "description": "This is an introductory level course in investments.

Subjects such as food security, food sustainability and food waste management will be the main focus for every week's seminar.A convergence of factors has made food security one of the most important global issues. An increasing population wants a more varied diet, but is trying to grow more food on less land with limited access to water, all the time facing increased costs for fertiliser, and fuel for storage and transport.Even after food is grown, stored and transported, serious losses can occur, and in developing nations where `plentiful? food is wasted. A review of food waste in the US calculated that around 20% of the amount available to consume, was lost from retailing onwards. This translate to 20% of the land, water, labour, seed, pesticide and fertiliser are wasted in the process and thus this is also a financial and environmental loss too.In view of the growing world population and thus a growing demand in food, most of the food produced today is reflective of an unsustainable food system. This food is dependent on foreign oil, is destroying soil, contaminates water, has caused disease outbreaks, and may be robbing our future generations of the ability to grow food at all."}, "CE1003": {"name": "INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTATIONAL THINKING", "au": "  3.0", "program": "CE", "mutually_exclusive": "BG2211, BS1009, CH2107, CV1014, CZ1003, EE1005, MA1008, MS1008, PS0001, RE1016", "not_available_to_program": "AERO(2018-onwards)(Non Direct Entry), AERO(2019-onwards)(Direct Entry), ASEC(2018-onwards), BCG, BEEC(2018-onwards), BIE(2018-onwards)(Non Direct Entry), BIE(2019-onwards)(Direct Entry), BMS(2018-onwards), BS(2018-onwards), BSB(2018-onwards), BSPY(2018-onwards), CBE(2018-onwards)(Non Direct Entry), CBE(2019-onwards)(Direct Entry), CBEC(2018-onwards), CEE(2018-onwards)(Non Direct Entry), CEE(2019-onwards)(Direct Entry), CHEM(2018-onwards), CSC, CSEC, CVEC(2018-onwards), DSAI, EEE(2018-onwards)(Non Direct Entry), EEE(2019-onwards)(Direct Entry), EEEC(2018-onwards), EESS(2018-onwards), ENE(2018-onwards)(Non Direct Entry), ENE(2019-onwards)(Direct Entry), ENEC(2018-onwards), ENG(2018-onwards), ENG(CEE)(2018-onwards), ENG(EEE)(2018-onwards), ENG(ENE)(2018-onwards), ENG(ME)(2018-onwards), ESPP(2018-onwards), IEEC(2018-onwards), IEM(2018-onwards)(Non Direct Entry), IEM(2019-onwards)(Direct Entry), MACS, MAEO(2018-onwards), MAT(2018-onwards)(Non Direct Entry), MAT(2019-onwards)(Direct Entry), MATH(2018-onwards), ME(2018-onwards)(Non Direct Entry), ME(2019-onwards)(Direct Entry), ME(DES)(2018-onwards)(Non Direct Entry), ME(DES)(2019-onwards)(Direct Entry), ME(RMS)(2018-onwards)(Non Direct Entry), ME(RMS)(2019-onwards)(Direct Entry), MEEC(2018-onwards), MS(2018-onwards), MS-2ndMaj/Spec(MSB)(2018-onwards), MTEC(2018-onwards), PHY(2018-onwards), REP(2018-onwards)", "not_available_to_program_with": null, "not_available_as_core_to_program": null, "not_available_as_UE_to_program": null, "not_available_as_PE_to_program": null, "prerequisite": null, "grade_type": null, "description": "Computational thinking (CT) is a problem solving process with the aid of computer; i.e. formulating a problem and expressing its solution in such a way that a computer can effectively carry it out.

Students will observe faults, folds, pervasive deformation structures,sedimentary sequences,and complex igneous units.Area 2 - Panum Crater,CAStudents will map a young rhyolitic eruptive center.They will identify different eruptive units,! observe and interpret ductile and brittle rock fabrics,and construct a conceptual model of the evolution of Panum Crater during its life cycle.Area 3 - Lundy Canyon, CAStudents will map surficial sediments and geomorphic features related to multiple cycles ofglaciation, Pleistocene lake levelfluctuations,delta formation,and range-front normalfaulting.They will create a detailed geomorphic-geological map and investigate the relationships between 1 peak glaciation,lake level high stand,and long-term uplift of the Sierra Nevada mountains.Rest daysApproximately one day per week, students will participate in a short morning field exercise andthen travel into a nearby town to wash clothes,rest, and participate in voluntary short fieldexcursions in the region. After spending the night in proper accommodations, they will return to the field and participate in afternoon field work.Final field tourThe last days of the field camp will be used for regional field excursions, which will challenge thestudents to integrate their field experiences into an overarching picture of the geological evolution of the East Sierra Nevada region.Camp participationThe essential skills of independent field work include the ability to cook, clean, perform tasks that benefit the camp as needed,and maintain good work ing relationships with other camp members.

Burckhardt was writing about Catholic Italy, however, and the individuals this course will examine lived in England, under absolutist Tudor and Stuart monarchs, during a time when the Protestant reformation was giving rise to new democratic ideologies. These writers witnessed the systematic demolition of English Catholicism, and of the feudal society that it entailed, by Henry VIII and his children. The ensuing tension between monarchy and democracy resulted in the English civil war, a conflict which produced, among other things, Milton's epic poem, Paradise Lost. The texts chosen for this course demonstrate that, despite the excitement produced by new discoveries in art, science and geography, the emotion of loss suffuses the literature of the century leading up to the civil war, and this must qualify any notion that the history of the English renaissance is an unambiguous progress-narrative.

Game theory, besides being of fundamental mathematical interest, is a main tool to model economic and strategic situations and then study the behavior of rational agents in such situations. Mechanism design is the study of how to design games (such as auctions) so that agents have incentive to act in a desirable way, e.g. by telling the truth. This course will improve your ability to model and analyze economics situations in a mathematical way. We will study the way rational agents will play games, based on their assumptions about the rationality of other agents. We will learn about the concept of Nash equilibria, which are solutions to games that no rational agent has an incentive to deviate from, and learn how to compute these. In the second part of the course we turn to the problem of social choice, namely choosing from a set of alternatives, given the preferences of a set of players. We will see that many desirable properties of social choice functions cannot be satisfied, and then turn to ways to deal with this issue. The first way is to introduce payments and money-valued preferences, which leads to auction theory and related topics.

Module 1 introduces what is Systems Thinking and how does it relate to Systems Engineering.  Systems Thinking is a dialectical way of thinking that relates real-world needs and problems to idealized conceptual models in order to explore and develop viable solutions. A systemic approach is adopted that emphasizes both logic and culture, as in human behaviour, in problem solving. It recognises that the world is a set of highly interconnected technical and social entities which are hierarchically organised producing emergent properties.  Systems Thinking is an essential skill for Systems Engineers which is shared with many disciplines and provides a key intellectual underpinning for Systems Engineering and program management.Module 2 provides first a conceptual-level description of Systems Engineering discipline. It then follows up with application aspects of the systems engineering processes and practices that relate to the life cycle development and management of an engineered system.  The course aims to provide an overview of how a quality engineered system is developed based broadly on an extended life-cycle model from defining a business case, addressing stakeholders? needs and requirements, developing systems requirements, functional and physical architecture, to systems design and build, systems integration and verification, and final validation and acceptance.  This course also gives emphasis to the interdependency between Systems Engineering and Program Management, with both disciplines enabled by Systems Thinking and methodologies. Teaching cases will be used to illustrate the economic, technical and programmatic benefits of applying systems thinking and systems engineering practices in the planning, development and deployment of complex products and systems.  A special topic will be introduced to gain an appreciation of the strategy and architecture of Industry 4.0. A system of systems perspective will be encouraged to gain additional insights of this 4th Industrial Revolution and how it will shape the future of manufacturing."}, "MT1001": {"name": "MATHEMATICS I FOR MARITIME STUDIES", "au": "  3.0", "program": "MS(CEE)", "mutually_exclusive": "MT1101", "not_available_to_program": "MAT", "not_available_to_program_with": null, "not_available_as_core_to_program": null, "not_available_as_UE_to_program": null, "not_available_as_PE_to_program": null, "prerequisite": null, "grade_type": null, "description": "Function and graph.

A painting or a sculpture is often valued in monetary terms; it is traded just like any commodity and changes hands at different prices. This course discusses the different aspects of the global art market that creates and consumes the visual arts by tracking the different pathways an artwork can take from artist-to-owner. From artists who are paid millions for their products to the buyers who speculate in art purely for profit, from auction houses who encourage a laissez-faire attitude to the sale of authentic art to the countless crooks who copy artworks for deceit, the complexities of the visual arts today cannot be understood without us acknowledging that this epitome of `human-ness' is very much a product with a price-tag.Attendance is a requirement as there are continual and formative assessments."}, "AAA08B": {"name": "FASHION & DESIGN: WEARABLE ART AS A SECOND SKIN", "au": "  3.0", "program": "NIE", "mutually_exclusive": null, "not_available_to_program": "ARED, SCED", "not_available_to_program_with": null, "not_available_as_core_to_program": null, "not_available_as_UE_to_program": null, "not_available_as_PE_to_program": null, "prerequisite": "Students are req to purchase approx $60 of Art materials", "grade_type": null, "description": "Develop process skills in expression and visual articulation through the creation of wearable art works as a second skin.

But true innovative methods and models can only grow out of new philosophies, thinking, and principles.  This course is explorative in essence. We will first discuss the significant implications of the economic trends and analyze some of the basic economic elements and their relationships from network perspective. We will then lay down a set of principles of the Network Economy. The novel theory, both in micro and macro, can explain, for example, the reasons behind Singapore's economic success. The principles can also guide an enterprise to renovate its business model dynamically to create sustainable values. As one most important takeaway, participants will develop a new model of thinking and a new mindset changing from point-wise thinking to network-wise thinking. The topic on Supply Chain and Logistics Management is discussed in the framework of Network Economy. Supply chain and logistics management deals with the management of flows in a network consisting of suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and customers across all activities such as designing, purchasing, manufacturing, distributing, and customer services.

The student?s task will be to evaluate the various perspectives and form a reasoned judgment as to how the central questions of the course should be answered. The questions to be considered include the following: ? How does one reason about morality? ? Can moral claims be objectively true? ? What is the morally right thing to do? And what makes it right? ?
