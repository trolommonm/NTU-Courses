It focuses on sustainability issues related to the various aspects of business management, such as business policy and strategy design from both an economic and environmental perspective. To provide a good understanding of the business context of sustainability, this first part will begin by exploring its development and regulatory contexts at the global level. It will then be followed by an in-depth examination of the impact of environmental sustainability at industry and firm levels, exploring its influence on industry business practices, corporate strategies and management policies.    The second part, comprising the remaining 6 seminars, discusses some of the contemporary marketing thoughts in environmentalism, social responsibility and marketing ethics. It further examines the issues involved in green marketing mix decision-making and strategy implementation. To achieve this end, students will first be introduced to the various meanings and challenges of Green Marketing. They will then be exposed to existing empirical studies in green consumerism. This will be followed by in-depth discussions of the issues faced by marketers in the design and implementation of the green marketing. For instance, green product issues concerning R&D, packaging, labeling and certification will be examined. Other green marketing mix issues included are greenwashing and green retailing, etc. "}, "AB0601": {"name": "COMMUNICATION MANAGEMENT FUNDAMENTALS", "au": "  2.0", "program": "ACC", "mutually_exclusive": "AB114", "not_available": "ACBS(GA) 2, ACBS(GA) 3, ACBS(GA) 4, ACBS(GB) 1, ACBS(GB) 2, ACBS(GB) 3, ACBS(GB) 4, ACC(GA) 1, ACC(GA) 2, ACC(GA) 3, ACC(GB) 2, ACC(GB) 3, BCE 2, BCE 3, BCE 4, BCG 2, BCG 3, BCG 4, BUS 2, BUS 3, BUS(GA) 1", "prerequisite": null, "grade_type": null, "description": "Communication Management Fundamentals introduces students to the crucial communication skills required of today's employees, young entrepreneurs and job hunters.

More than ever before, the ability to communicate effectively determines an employee's capacity to thrive in his or her career and to be in demand by employers. Entrepreneurs, alike, must also communicate well in order to articulate and present their ideas to customers, suppliers, the government, and other partners in the business ecosystem.This course is structured to hone students' business communication skills, especially to prevail in an employment situation and to communicate positive-informative messages at work or in business overall. Students will be assessed on their ability to devise clear communication strategies, write effectively, prepare and deliver compelling oral presentations, and share and address feedback.The importance of social media and its profound impact on the way people communicate today will also be explored as will be the most effective manner in which such platforms are harnessed for employees and businesses alike.Specifically, this course aims to develop students? skills in communication management: writing, speaking, listening, and working in teams. The three main objectives of the course are the following:1. Written communication: Students will learn to strategize and organize a positive-informative    message in a professional, high quality business document by effectively adapting to the    contextual requirements and the needs of the given audience.2. Social media communication: Students will explore and critique good practices for personal    and/or company image management to better understand the various risks and opportunities    presented by social media to both individuals and organizations. 3.

The access to such analytics capability is often hampered by the problem of data silos, in which data for different departments, divisions, product lines, etc., is stored and managed differently. Enterprise Systems are major investments that seek to minimize such problems. They form the backbone of organizations' business processes and hold the key to unlock strategic data assets within the firms. This course is designed to provide an overview to enterprise systems, primarily covering the range of embedded 'best practice' business processes (e.g., order-to-cash, procure-to-pay, production planning and execution, accounting) and the related data that needs to be carefully managed. Our objective is to develop an application consulting perspective among the students that is sensitive to managerial issues in assessing, configuring, and managing the radical implementation of enterprise systems and using the insights from such enterprise systems. A specific emphasis is on the extraction, manipulation, and exploitation of such enterprise data to optimize processes, decisions, and business performance. This is particularly pertinent as many organizations do not have just one enterprise system but also other systems where the other databases are kept (e.g., spreadsheets, vendor databases, legacy systems, web data).The course places a dual emphasis on both conceptual learning (through student-led presentations and business case discussions on enterprise analytics) and practical exposures to enterprise systems (through heavy hands-on lab on SAP and data analytics tools).

In this course, we regard IMC as a system of thinking, processes and coordinated activities driven by the marketer's objectives. Adopting a global perspective, we draw illustrative examples and cases from different parts of the world and discuss issues faced by marketers in conducting IMC programs across countries. The course is designed to develop your logical thinking and creativity regarding IMC.  Although this course is oriented towards practice, we still cover theories and concepts that explain how marketing communication (marcom) practices work and their applicability.  Using these theories and concepts to analyse practices, you will be able to choose and design marcom activities judiciously, justify your choice, and appraise the effectiveness of the activities.Instead of treating IMC as a set of stand-alone tools or activities, the course regards it as a blended mix of coordinated activities.  The course put roughly equal emphasis on both traditional marcom tools (e.g., advertising and sales promotion) and non-traditional tools (e.g., search engine marketing and social media marketing).  The course compares the similarities and differences of these tools, and explains how they can work together for achieving the marketer's objectives.

Cyber physical systems are the driving force behind modern civilization, being integral part of technologies, such as additive manufacturing, smartcard-based payment, power delivery systems, drone-based operations, and smart home automation. Cyber physical systems are characterized by stringent performance requirements, such as, extremely low energy budget, small area footprint and often hard real-time constraints. Due to the pervasive nature of the cyber physical systems in our everyday lives, it also runs the risk of huge security hazards.In this course, we will learn about the basics of cyber physical systems, including the design principles and methodologies. Further, there will be a detailed treatment of the security challenges for cyber physical systems, which vary in practice due to the diverse nature of the application environment of cyber physical systems. These different forms of security breaches, observed across diverse cyber physical systems, will be put in a well-characterized taxonomy, to be systematically identified as attack surfaces. The techniques to handle these attacks will be described in a generic manner, including key management and wireless/RFID communication. The attack surfaces and protection/mitigation principles will then be elaborated with practical case studies, from the representative cyber physical systems such as automotive, smart card systems and smart grid.

Cyber physical systems are the driving force behind modern civilization, being integral part of technologies, such as additive manufacturing, smartcard-based payment, power delivery systems, drone-based operations, and smart home automation. Cyber physical systems are characterized by stringent performance requirements, such as, extremely low energy budget, small area footprint and often hard real-time constraints. Due to the pervasive nature of the cyber physical systems in our everyday lives, it also runs the risk of huge security hazards.In this course, we will learn about the basics of cyber physical systems, including the design principles and methodologies. Further, there will be a detailed treatment of the security challenges for cyber physical systems, which vary in practice due to the diverse nature of the application environment of cyber physical systems. These different forms of security breaches, observed across diverse cyber physical systems, will be put in a well-characterized taxonomy, to be systematically identified as attack surfaces. The techniques to handle these attacks will be described in a generic manner, including key management and wireless/RFID communication. The attack surfaces and protection/mitigation principles will then be elaborated with practical case studies, from the representative cyber physical systems such as automotive, smart card systems and smart grid.

This crisis of authority (reason versus revelation, evidence versus faith), exacerbated by the political upheavals and constitutional debates in the wake of England's Civil Wars and the Glorious Revolution, sent shock waves through all levels of society, including the domestic.

This course explores three important elements of the history of time: its intellectual conception and cultural representation; its scientific and technological quantification, rationalization, and mastery; and its role in structuring societies and their activities. First, over the course of history, different cultures have conceived of time in a variety of ways (e.g. circular, cyclical, progressive) and on many different scales (e.g. cosmic, geologic, civilizational, industrial). In turn, these cultural conceptions of time have given rise to different ideas about the relationship of individual human lives to societies, and societies to history as a whole. Second, the effort to quantify time has given rise to a distinct science and technology of time-keeping, from the ancient sun-dial to today?s atomic clock. Third, the consciousness and quantification of time has made possible numerous social institutions and practices, ranging from the invention of interest on debt to the modern state to the institution of wage-labor.

Topics are organized functionally so as to maintain student focus on the relationship between form and function. The broader organization will first outline speech production, and then the processes of speech perception and the associated mechanisms of hearing will be discussed. Within each topic, the key elements of the musculoskeletal system are described first, and then the  physiological  principles governing their operation are covered. Because of the natural anatomical overlap across functional topics, each layer discussed will build on the last.The course will first cover the mechanism of respiration. Next, phonation, pitch, and laryngeal articulation (including protective maneuvers) will be introduced and  the relationship between laryngeal control and respiration will be elucidated. These components will be connected to the notion of the sound source (in acoustic theoretic terms). Students will be introduced to live demonstrations of low-dimensional biomechanical models of the vocal folds and the basic  elements of myoelastic- aerodynamic theory will be discussed. Laryngoscopy  and laryngeal ultrasound for speech and non-speech processes will also be used to support anatomical and physiological theory, and students will be required to know how to identify the laryngeal structures as observed with these instrumental techniques.The mechanism of the  supralaryngeal structures will then be discussed. This is a broad subject area and its subtopics include the jaw, the tongue and pharynx, the velopharyngeal port and nasal cavity, and the lips. A significant amount of attention will be given to the structure of the bones of the skull and their muscular connections. Each of these components will  be illustrated using biomechanical models developed in ArtiSynth to visually demonstrate to students the individual and joint effects of muscle action on the articulators. Students will be made aware of how this supralaryngeal component concerns the acoustic filter of the vocal tract and live demonstrations of articulatory  speech  synthesizers  (such  as  VocaiTractlab;  http://www.vocaltractlab.de/) will reinforce this principle. Students will also be exposed to speech imaging data in the form of MRI and lingual ultrasound. Students will be required to identify relevant vocal tract structures observable with these methods. Once the full mechanism is outlined, speech-related processes will be introduced with a focus on consonant and vowel production. The laryngeal components of these, such  as  voicing  and  aspiration,  will allow students to integrate what they learned about the larynx into the subject of supralaryngeal    articulation.   Students   will   gain   an   appreciation   of   the   complexorchestration involved in producing basic eve sequences and be required to producedetailed  descriptions  of  the  physiological  events  involved  such  sequences,  includingthose discussed in relation to the larynx. Students will also gain an appreciation of how the life-supporting functions of chewing and swallowing relate to speech. Some attentionwill also be given to the muscles of the lower face and their use in facial expression.The course will then focus on the perceptual side of speech and introduce the mechanism of hearing by examining, in turn, the outer, middle, and inner ear. Students will be taught about theories of aural sensation and be introduced to  some  of  the physical principles governing the hearing mechanism, including impedance transformation and the mechanoelectrical transduction processes of the hair cells. Some discussion will be given to the neural ear and how speech sounds become perceived by the brain.The students will be introduced briefly to the  anatomy of the brain and the  cranial nerves. The details of these topics will be related back to the preceding major sections of the course concerning speech production  and  perception by describing  (in light detail) the neural pathways involved in motor control of speech, including the topics of the reflex arc, muscle spindles, and proprioception, and those for the perception of (speech) sound.The final topic discussed will introduce the topic of ontogenetic development of the vocal tract structures. Development in general will be briefly described and the students will be introduced to some of the genetic mechanisms that guide this process (with the side effect of sowing an interest for a potential course about Language and Genetics). Students will then be given a short tour of the developing vocal tract. A final link will then be made to phylogenetic development of vocal  tract structures, with an equally short survey of the comparative morphology of structures found in other specifies that are homologous to those of the human vocal tract. Variation of vocal tract structures as a function of factors such as age, sex, and broad ethnic-background, will also  be noted and supported with irnaging data whenever possible.Key subjects covered include:1.\tusing  anatomical  and  physiological  terminology  to  describe  the  processes  ofspeech production and perception;2.\tthe relationship between the auditory categories of the IPA and the mechanismsof speech production;3.\tan  appreciation  of the  link  (and  sometimes  lack  thereof)  between  anatomical form and physiological function;4.\tan appreciation of the relationship between physical principles (such as acoustics or aerodynamics) and the processes of speech and hearing;5.\tpractice interpreting anatomical and speech-instrumentation  data."}, "HG8002": {"name": "THE STORY OF ENGLISH", "au": "  3.0", "program": "LMS(SOH)", "mutually_exclusive": null, "not_available": null, "prerequisite": null, "grade_type": null, "description": "The course explores and studies the origins, changes, and reasons for changes in the grammar, sounds, and vocabulary of English from the beginnings of the language to modern times.

The course addresses an engaging topic in order to familiarise students with a number of important social scientific concepts, and to develop their critical thinking skills."}, "HG8008": {"name": "LINGUARAMA", "au": "  3.0", "program": "LMS(SOH)", "mutually_exclusive": "HG2099, HG8009", "not_available": null, "prerequisite": "LA-Yr1 intake from AY14/D.entry fromAY15;LS for others", "grade_type": null, "description": "This course takes into account evolutionary, ethnic, geographical and historical factors that have led to the development and spread of the roughly 7000 languages that are currently spoken in the world.

Finally, we consider how Sherlock Holmes stories have entered into popular culture, both through translation into other languages and into other media, such as films and TV.2.\tIn the first half of the course, we will look at how words convey meanings and how they can be combined to express richer meaning (semantics). We will show that meaning does not only come from the words themselves, but also from our own understanding of them, and that words can convey much more than simple truth-conditional meanings (pragmatics).3.\tIn the second half of the course, we will show how the stories (and other works adapted from them) convey meaning to the reader, as well as how the meaning becomes part of our cultural heritage."}, "MS0002": {"name": "ENGINEERS & SOCIETY", "au": "  3.0", "program": "MAT", "mutually_exclusive": "MS4030", "not_available": null, "prerequisite": null, "grade_type": null, "description": "Our country.

The reality is a bit more convoluted; an artwork may be used to elicit intangible feelings in the viewer, but it also has a tangible value as a commodity. A painting or a sculpture is often valued in monetary terms; it is traded just like any commodity and changes hands at different prices. This course discusses the different aspects of the global art market that creates and consumes the visual arts by tracking the different pathways an artwork can take from artist-to-owner. From artists who are paid millions for their products to the buyers who speculate in art purely for profit, from auction houses who encourage a laissez-faire attitude to the sale of authentic art to the countless crooks who copy artworks for deceit, the complexities of the visual arts today cannot be understood without us acknowledging that this epitome of `human-ness? is very much a product with a price-tag.Attendance is a requirement."}, "AAA08B": {"name": "FASHION & DESIGN: WEARABLE ART AS A SECOND SKIN", "au": "  3.0", "program": "NIE", "mutually_exclusive": null, "not_available": "ARED, SCED", "prerequisite": "Req to purchase materials (tools, brushes, paper, etc)", "grade_type": null, "description": "Develop process skills in expression and visual articulation through the creation of wearable art works as a second skin.

One major category of proposals state that race and gender are socially constructed categories.  Another major category of proposals says that concepts of race and gender can be grounded in biology, albeit in a different way that the ?commonsense? view claims.  Strengths and weaknesses of each of these proposals are examined.The second half of the module builds on the first half by examining the social, political, and ethical dimensions of race and gender.  One overarching topic concerns the relationship between race/gender and inequality, as well as arguments for and against proposals such as affirmative action that are intended to remedy racial/gender inequalities.  Another major topic is the role that race and gender plays in shaping our social and political institutions, with specific sub-topics including race/gender and political representation as well as the role of race and gender in the criminal justice system.  A third topic is the psychology of race and gender, with particular attention to the ways in which stereotypes can (often unconsciously) shape our interactions and expectations.
