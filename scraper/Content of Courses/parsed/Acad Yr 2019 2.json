It focuses on sustainability issues related to the various aspects of business management, such as business policy and strategy design from both an economic and environmental perspective. To provide a good understanding of the business context of sustainability, this first part will begin by exploring its development and regulatory contexts at the global level. It will then be followed by an in-depth examination of the impact of environmental sustainability at industry and firm levels, exploring its influence on industry business practices, corporate strategies and management policies.    The second part, comprising the remaining 6 seminars, discusses some of the contemporary marketing thoughts in environmentalism, social responsibility and marketing ethics. It further examines the issues involved in green marketing mix decision-making and strategy implementation. To achieve this end, students will first be introduced to the various meanings and challenges of Green Marketing. They will then be exposed to existing empirical studies in green consumerism. This will be followed by in-depth discussions of the issues faced by marketers in the design and implementation of the green marketing. For instance, green product issues concerning R&D, packaging, labeling and certification will be examined. Other green marketing mix issues included are greenwashing and green retailing, etc. "}, "AB0502": {"name": "MANAGING SUSTAINABILITY", "au": "  3.0", "program": "ACC", "mutually_exclusive": "AB0001, AB0301, AB0401, AB0402, AB0501, AB0603", "not_available_to_program": "ACBS(GA)-2ndMaj/Spec(ACS) 3, ACBS(GA)-2ndMaj/Spec(ITT) 3, ACBS(GA)-2ndMaj/Spec(PBL) 3, ACBS(GA)-2ndMaj/Spec(RMI) 3, ACBS(GB)-2ndMaj/Spec(ACS) 3, ACBS(GB)-2ndMaj/Spec(BA) 3, ACBS(GB)-2ndMaj/Spec(BAF) 3, ACBS(GB)-2ndMaj/Spec(HRC) 3, ACBS(GB)-2ndMaj/Spec(ITT) 3, ACBS(GB)-2ndMaj/Spec(MKG) 3, ACBS(GB)-2ndMaj/Spec(PBL) 3, ACBS(GB)-2ndMaj/Spec(RMI) 3, ACC(2019-onwards), ACC(GB) 2, BCE(2015-onwards), BCG(2015-onwards), BUS(HRC) 2, BUS(MKG) 2", "not_available_to_all_program_with": null, "not_available_as_core_to_program": null, "not_available_as_UE_to_program": null, "not_available_as_PE_to_program": null, "prerequisite": "Only opened to NBS students.

Achieving organizational sustainable development and operation involves the engagement with and management of the full range of stakeholders; including customer, shareholder, corporate, community, government and non-government. Geographical dimensions range from local to regional to International. Many organizations now accept sustainability as important to their mission and have strategized for this. Yet outcomes have been mixed, at best. Organizations struggle to align their business and sustainable objectives, something that critics including their customers and NGOs are quick to point out and often do so loudly to corporate detriment. This course focuses on the planning, development and management of sustainability as a central and integral component of successful business outcomes as undertaken in the Asia Pacific region. The course has an applied bias that brings the essence of sustainability theory into practical industry application where the perspectives of the different stakeholders are central to success as a clear understanding of the complexities of Asian contexts. No prior knowledge of the principles or application of sustainability is required, as this course will be delivered accordingly. Participants in this course will address large- and small-scale organizations in a variety of Asian contexts.

In particular, it seeks to provide students with some insightful perspectives on how Asian companies can begin on their journeys to become global competitors. Asian companies must learn to adapt to the fast-changing rules of global competition, when many of these rules are enacted by the West. The recent sagas against Chinese companies on toys, milk products, textiles and other related products are examples for Asian companies to realize that they cannot operate independently of international opinions, norms, and sensitivities. Without a doubt, Asian companies must continue to improve their management and learn to strategize better to effectively deal with the West. They need to improve their global competitiveness, learn to build world-class businesses and brands, and how to establish sustainable global companies in order to rival the Western multi-national corporations.

The course is designed to develop your logical thinking and creativity regarding IMC.  Although this course is oriented towards practice, we still cover theories and concepts that explain how marketing communication (marcom) practices work and their applicability.  Using these theories and concepts to analyse practices, you will be able to choose and design marcom activities judiciously, justify your choice, and appraise the effectiveness of the activities.Instead of treating IMC as a set of stand-alone tools or activities, the course regards it as a blended mix of coordinated activities.  The course put roughly equal emphasis on both traditional marcom tools (e.g., advertising and sales promotion) and non-traditional tools (e.g., search engine marketing and social media marketing).  The course compares the similarities and differences of these tools, and explains how they can work together for achieving the marketer's objectives.  While non-traditional marcom tools catch marketers' attention nowadays, traditional marcom tools are indispensable for particular purposes and under certain circumstances.

This course is specially designed to help students understand how humans (consumers, doctors, accountants, policy makers, managers, parents, and students themselves) make -good or bad- decisions. Ever since Daniel Kahneman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002, we have a more accurate understanding of the fact that people do not necessarily obey rational rules in making decisions. This does not mean that decisions are made randomly; on the contrary, an alternate set of rules is at play. Even though the human brain is capable of making millions of calculations per second, it cannot avoid the influences of these biases. Research in cognitive sciences, psychology, behavioural economics and decision neuroscience is guiding us to a fuller understanding of how decisions are made by people. Empowered with this knowledge, you (students) will not only improve your own decision making but also explore ways to design organizations that help people make better decisions. You will learn the decision-making processes and biases that impact choice behaviour. Examples include but not limited to: What are examples of irrational decision making and what are the reasons of this behavior? How do customers make their purchase choices? How do people decide to save (or not)? How do we persuade people to climb the stairs instead of using the elevator? How do our biology and brain influence our decision making? How does the environment influence our behaviour? How does the brain assess risk, trust, time? Overall, you will develop strategic awareness about the biases that could influence judgment and lead to suboptimal decisions."}, "BU9302": {"name": "LAW OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY & NEW MEDIA", "au": "  3.0", "program": "BUS", "mutually_exclusive": "BL9302", "not_available_to_program": "ACBS, ACC, BCE, BCG, BUS", "not_available_to_all_program_with": null, "not_available_as_core_to_program": null, "not_available_as_UE_to_program": null, "not_available_as_PE_to_program": null, "prerequisite": null, "grade_type": null, "remark": null, "description": "This course is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the current law for the protection of electronic information and electronic content as forms of property.

While films are generally seen as a leisure activity, the cinema cannot be divorced from society and the pressing issues of our times. It can function as a forum in which viewers are not only entertained but informed and educated and cognitively prepared to develop good citizenship. The audience is presented with topics and issues of great concern in the community, which are often controversial, and certainly provocative. This module seeks to stimulate and inspire students towards a more critical view of cinema as a medium that challenges viewing practices and cognitive senses through the content of the films. Students will be taught to understand the cinema as a medium of social communication, presenting stories that question our views of society and politics. The module will familiarize students with a range of cinematic works, key readings and important trends in contemporary global cinema and, secondly, to develop critical tools and skills in analyzing contemporary films with respect to both their aesthetic properties and their various historical, social, political determinants."}, "CS4097": {"name": "OVERSEAS DIGITAL DOCUMENTARY - 'ODYSSEE'", "au": "  4.0", "program": "CS", "mutually_exclusive": null, "not_available_to_program": null, "not_available_to_all_program_with": null, "not_available_as_core_to_program": null, "not_available_as_UE_to_program": null, "not_available_as_PE_to_program": null, "prerequisite": "CS2025", "grade_type": null, "remark": null, "description": "The course is concerned with researching and producing short overseas digital documentaries underpinned by an introduction to the field of visual anthropology.

It documents the diplomatic, political, social and economic history of modern China and British Hong Kong. It examines how changing politics and events in China influenced Sino-British relations and the British colony during the period from 1945 to 1997, and vice versa. Hong Kong was important geo-politically. Due to geographical proximity, developments in China and Hong Kong always affected each other. The 1967 riots were a classic example. Historically, the legitimacy of British rule was never recognized by the Chinese governments. Tensions always existed between Britain and China over Hong Kong?s future constitutional settlement. Politically, the Chinese Communists and the western governments both treated Hong Kong as a strategic base during the Cold War, advocating competing ideologies. Economically, it served as an economic gateway for the Communist regime to trade with foreign powers and earn foreign exchange. Hong Kong was also unique. Scholars promoted the concept that Hong Kong was a peculiar colony. The colonial government exercised a policy of indirect rule, combining economic laissez-faire with some interventions in for example the provision of social housing. The society underwent rapid urbanization but remained relatively stable. Western and Chinese culture blended. Hong Kong Chinese increasingly differentiated themselves from Mainland Chinese. This module examines the connections between China and British Hong Kong via seven inter-locking themes: changing Sino-British diplomatic relations, imperial diplomacy, colonial state-building, social order, identity, political culture and economic dynamism. Through exploring the modern history of China and British Hong Kong, useful insights in China?s development, international relations and British colonialism can be acquired.

Topics are organized functionally so as to maintain student focus on the relationship between form and function. The broader organization will first outline speech production, and then the processes of speech perception and the associated mechanisms of hearing will be discussed. Within each topic, the key elements of the musculoskeletal system are described first, and then the  physiological  principles governing their operation are covered. Because of the natural anatomical overlap across functional topics, each layer discussed will build on the last.The course will first cover the mechanism of respiration. Next, phonation, pitch, and laryngeal articulation (including protective maneuvers) will be introduced and  the relationship between laryngeal control and respiration will be elucidated. These components will be connected to the notion of the sound source (in acoustic theoretic terms). Students will be introduced to live demonstrations of low-dimensional biomechanical models of the vocal folds and the basic  elements of myoelastic- aerodynamic theory will be discussed. Laryngoscopy  and laryngeal ultrasound for speech and non-speech processes will also be used to support anatomical and physiological theory, and students will be required to know how to identify the laryngeal structures as observed with these instrumental techniques.The mechanism of the  supralaryngeal structures will then be discussed. This is a broad subject area and its subtopics include the jaw, the tongue and pharynx, the velopharyngeal port and nasal cavity, and the lips. A significant amount of attention will be given to the structure of the bones of the skull and their muscular connections. Each of these components will  be illustrated using biomechanical models developed in ArtiSynth to visually demonstrate to students the individual and joint effects of muscle action on the articulators. Students will be made aware of how this supralaryngeal component concerns the acoustic filter of the vocal tract and live demonstrations of articulatory  speech  synthesizers  (such  as  VocaiTractlab;  http://www.vocaltractlab.de/) will reinforce this principle. Students will also be exposed to speech imaging data in the form of MRI and lingual ultrasound. Students will be required to identify relevant vocal tract structures observable with these methods. Once the full mechanism is outlined, speech-related processes will be introduced with a focus on consonant and vowel production. The laryngeal components of these, such  as  voicing  and  aspiration,  will allow students to integrate what they learned about the larynx into the subject of supralaryngeal    articulation.   Students   will   gain   an   appreciation   of   the   complexorchestration involved in producing basic eve sequences and be required to producedetailed  descriptions  of  the  physiological  events  involved  such  sequences,  includingthose discussed in relation to the larynx. Students will also gain an appreciation of how the life-supporting functions of chewing and swallowing relate to speech. Some attentionwill also be given to the muscles of the lower face and their use in facial expression.The course will then focus on the perceptual side of speech and introduce the mechanism of hearing by examining, in turn, the outer, middle, and inner ear. Students will be taught about theories of aural sensation and be introduced to  some  of  the physical principles governing the hearing mechanism, including impedance transformation and the mechanoelectrical transduction processes of the hair cells. Some discussion will be given to the neural ear and how speech sounds become perceived by the brain.The students will be introduced briefly to the  anatomy of the brain and the  cranial nerves. The details of these topics will be related back to the preceding major sections of the course concerning speech production  and  perception by describing  (in light detail) the neural pathways involved in motor control of speech, including the topics of the reflex arc, muscle spindles, and proprioception, and those for the perception of (speech) sound.The final topic discussed will introduce the topic of ontogenetic development of the vocal tract structures. Development in general will be briefly described and the students will be introduced to some of the genetic mechanisms that guide this process (with the side effect of sowing an interest for a potential course about Language and Genetics). Students will then be given a short tour of the developing vocal tract. A final link will then be made to phylogenetic development of vocal  tract structures, with an equally short survey of the comparative morphology of structures found in other specifies that are homologous to those of the human vocal tract. Variation of vocal tract structures as a function of factors such as age, sex, and broad ethnic-background, will also  be noted and supported with irnaging data whenever possible.Key subjects covered include:1.\tusing  anatomical  and  physiological  terminology  to  describe  the  processes  ofspeech production and perception;2.\tthe relationship between the auditory categories of the IPA and the mechanismsof speech production;3.\tan  appreciation  of the  link  (and  sometimes  lack  thereof)  between  anatomical form and physiological function;4.\tan appreciation of the relationship between physical principles (such as acoustics or aerodynamics) and the processes of speech and hearing;5.\tpractice interpreting anatomical and speech-instrumentation  data."}, "HG8002": {"name": "THE STORY OF ENGLISH", "au": "  3.0", "program": "LMS(SOH)", "mutually_exclusive": null, "not_available_to_program": null, "not_available_to_all_program_with": null, "not_available_as_core_to_program": null, "not_available_as_UE_to_program": null, "not_available_as_PE_to_program": null, "prerequisite": null, "grade_type": null, "remark": null, "description": "The course explores and studies the origins, changes, and reasons for changes in the grammar, sounds, and vocabulary of English from the beginnings of the language to modern times.

Module 1 introduces what is Systems Thinking and how does it relate to Systems Engineering.  Systems Thinking is a dialectical way of thinking that relates real-world needs and problems to idealized conceptual models in order to explore and develop viable solutions. A systemic approach is adopted that emphasizes both logic and culture, as in human behaviour, in problem solving. It recognises that the world is a set of highly interconnected technical and social entities which are hierarchically organised producing emergent properties.  Systems Thinking is an essential skill for Systems Engineers which is shared with many disciplines and provides a key intellectual underpinning for Systems Engineering and program management.Module 2 provides first a conceptual-level description of Systems Engineering discipline. It then follows up with application aspects of the systems engineering processes and practices that relate to the life cycle development and management of an engineered system.  The course aims to provide an overview of how a quality engineered system is developed based broadly on an extended life-cycle model from defining a business case, addressing stakeholders? needs and requirements, developing systems requirements, functional and physical architecture, to systems design and build, systems integration and verification, and final validation and acceptance.  This course also gives emphasis to the interdependency between Systems Engineering and Program Management, with both disciplines enabled by Systems Thinking and methodologies. Teaching cases will be used to illustrate the economic, technical and programmatic benefits of applying systems thinking and systems engineering practices in the planning, development and deployment of complex products and systems.  A special topic will be introduced to gain an appreciation of the strategy and architecture of Industry 4.0. A system of systems perspective will be encouraged to gain additional insights of this 4th Industrial Revolution and how it will shape the future of manufacturing."}, "MT0001": {"name": "SHIPPING & THE ENVIRONMENT", "au": "  4.0", "program": "MS(CEE)", "mutually_exclusive": "MT3301", "not_available_to_program": null, "not_available_to_all_program_with": null, "not_available_as_core_to_program": null, "not_available_as_UE_to_program": null, "not_available_as_PE_to_program": null, "prerequisite": null, "grade_type": null, "remark": null, "description": "To provide students with an understanding of various operating environments in shipping.

A painting or a sculpture is often valued in monetary terms; it is traded just like any commodity and changes hands at different prices.

They will also learn about the production of vowels and consonants, as well as the various articulatory processes involved. Key aspects of English phonology: phonemes, phones, allophones, co-articulation effects, syllable structure, intonation, word and sentence stress will be covered. Student teachers will also be introduced to basic phonological theory and the concept of distinctive features. In the study of morphology, student teachers will learn the basic elements of English words: free (lexical/functional) and bound (derivational/inflectional) morphemes, and the distinction between morphs and allomorphs. In addition, they will deepen their understanding of the main word formation processes (e.g. borrowing, compounding, blending, clipping, etc.).
