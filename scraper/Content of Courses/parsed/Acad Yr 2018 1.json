In fact, much of everyday life is regulated and dictated by environmental law and policy of one kind or another.This course aims to provide students with a good overview of Environmental Sustainability Law and the policies that move the enactment of these laws, regulations, and guidelines. Students will study these issues from an international and national perspective and will have an appreciation of the roles and limitations of the law in resolving these issues.As we all live, work and often play in the built (man-made) environment, this course will devote considerable time examining the way our built environment can be developed to enable a sustainable future.

Its deceptively simple core theme of \"development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs? is now central for business success. Achieving organizational sustainable development and operation involves the engagement with and management of the full range of stakeholders; including customer, shareholder, corporate, community, government and non-government. Geographical dimensions range from local to regional to International. Many organizations now accept sustainability as important to their mission and have strategized for this. Yet outcomes have been mixed, at best. Organizations struggle to align their business and sustainable objectives, something that critics including their customers and NGOs are quick to point out and often do so loudly to corporate detriment. This course focuses on the planning, development and management of sustainability as a central and integral component of successful business outcomes as undertaken in the Asia Pacific region. The course has an applied bias that brings the essence of sustainability theory into practical industry application where the perspectives of the different stakeholders are central to success as a clear understanding of the complexities of Asian contexts. No prior knowledge of the principles or application of sustainability is required, as this course will be delivered accordingly. Participants in this course will address large- and small-scale organizations in a variety of Asian contexts. Ways of thinking about these, the issues involved and the crafting of proactive strategies are relevant to a range of business contexts.

In Interaction Design, you will survey the work and ideas of artists and designers who have explored interactive media, as well as the scientists, engineers and mathematicians who have developed information technologies. You will study the histories of certain technologies which have come to define the medium of personal computer and human-computer interaction. For Product Design, you will explore how design trends and movements are formed in the contexts of history, emphasizing human relationships between designed objects, visual imageries, art & design movements, science, technology, culture and society. In Visual Communication, you will gain a historical awareness of graphic design and its relationship to technology and industry practice. You will analyse design and designers from various eras through practice and theoretical research projects. This course will equip you with a solid foundation in design history and theory, and inform further study in contemporary design practice.Course Introduction and overviewAt the introduction to this course you will be introduced to an overview of how Interaction, Product, and Visual Communication each contribute to the history of design.You will then attend three sections where you will study each of these areas in 4-week blocks.Interaction DesignIn History of Interaction in Design you will explore the key principles of interaction. Firstly, the reciprocal exchange between the viewer and the artwork with the ability to manipulate media and objects intuitively. Secondly, The non-sequential linking of information, events, and discrete media. And thirdly, the experience of entering a multi-sensory representation of three-dimensional space. These three themes will be referred to as Interactivity, Hypermedia, and Immersion.?\tInteractivity: This topic explores the evolution of the graphical user interface and the technical, aesthetic, and cognitive concepts behind human-computer interactions, and their influence on the art, design and application of interactive media. ?\tHypermedia: A discussion of the evolution of hypermedia and the non-linear association of information resulting in the changing spatial and temporal boundaries in interactive media design.?\tImmersion: An exploration of the evolution of virtual reality and 3D virtual space: multimedia as an immersive experience that engages multiple senses.   Product DesignIn History of Product Design you will explore how objects and the built environment are produced in response to changes in thinking and ideas. These ideas evolve according to human values, contexts and conditions. Rationales and qualities of objects change, with new relationships being formed with individuals, societies and ecology, over the flow of the significant timelines: ?\tThe Industrial revolution?\tDesign Reform Movements in Europe and America?\tModernism & Post Modernism across the Atlantic?\tThe Conceptual in Art & Design?\tDiscursive & Immaterial FrontiersVisual CommunicationIn Visual Communication you will focus chiefly on the history and development of graphic design. This course facilitates you in locating, critically evaluating and presenting a variety of historical information from a variety of sources. Through an active learning strategy this course intends to engage you with design?s vast visual library and its social, political and technological contexts in order to underpin creative practice. Contemporary designers take inspiration from many sources and exploring graphic design?s past is one proven method of expanding visual vocabulary. The course will provide a concise overview of Graphic Design history focusing on the following periods:?\tThe Visual Word?\tThe Industrial Revolution?\tThe Modernist Era?\tThe Age of Information  Student PresentationsIn each section, Interaction, Product, and Visual Communication, you will deliver a 10 minute group presentation supported by a handout."}, "DD8002": {"name": "WAYS OF SEEING: EXPLORING VISUAL CULTURE", "au": "  3.0", "program": "ADM", "mutually_exclusive": "ADM270", "not_available_to_program": "ACBS 1, ACC 1, ADM 1, AERO 1, ASEC 1, BCE 1, BCG 1, BEEC 1, BIE 1, BMS 1, BS 1, BSPY 1, BUS 1, CBE 1, CBEC 1, CE 1, CEE 1, CEEC 1, CHEM 1, CHIN 1, CS 1, CSC 1, CSEC 1, CVEC 1, DSAI 1, ECMA 1, ECON 1, ECPP 1, ECPS 1, EEE 1, EEEC 1, EESS 1, ELAH 1, ELH 1, ENE 1, ENEC 1, ENG 1, ESPP 1, HIST 1, IEEC 1, IEM 1, LMS 1, MAEC 1, MAEO 1, MAT 1, MATH 1, ME(DES) 1, ME(NULL) 1, ME(RMS) 1, MEEC(DES) 1, MEEC(NULL) 1, MEEC(RMS) 1, MS 1, MS-2ndMaj/Spec(MSB) 1, MTEC 1, PHIL 1, PHY 1, PPGA 1, PSLM 1, PSMA 1, PSY 1, SOC 1, SSM 1", "not_available_to_program_with": null, "not_available_as_core_to_program": null, "prerequisite": null, "grade_type": null, "description": "What are the differences in the pictorial strategies adopted to picture space and time in European and East Asian painting?You will be shown a range of representations of the landscape, both natural and man-made to analyse the different approaches to picturing space and time.What are the differences in the approaches adopted to represent the human body and face in European, South and East Asian art?

To paraphrase Theodosius Dobzhansky, `nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution' (American Biology Teacher 35: 125-129). Evolution provides a historical narrative within which a biologist must explain the present behaviors. The study of evolution is thus central to our understanding of biology.

It is also relevant to us as consumers because we are exposed to hundreds of messages from marketers every day.This course is concerned with the development, implementation and evaluation of marketing communication activities.  The course primarily takes the marketer's perspective, requiring you to consider and critically evaluate factors influencing both the design and implementation of comprehensive, integrated marketing communication (IMC) programs.  In this course, we regard IMC as a system of thinking, processes and coordinated activities driven by the marketer's objectives. Adopting a global perspective, we draw illustrative examples and cases from different parts of the world and discuss issues faced by marketers in conducting IMC programs across countries. The course is designed to develop your logical thinking and creativity regarding IMC.  Although this course is oriented towards practice, we still cover theories and concepts that explain how marketing communication (marcom) practices work and their applicability.  Using these theories and concepts to analyse practices, you will be able to choose and design marcom activities judiciously, justify your choice, and appraise the effectiveness of the activities.Instead of treating IMC as a set of stand-alone tools or activities, the course regards it as a blended mix of coordinated activities.  The course put roughly equal emphasis on both traditional marcom tools (e.g., advertising and sales promotion) and non-traditional tools (e.g., search engine marketing and social media marketing).  The course compares the similarities and differences of these tools, and explains how they can work together for achieving the marketer's objectives.  While non-traditional marcom tools catch marketers' attention nowadays, traditional marcom tools are indispensable for particular purposes and under certain circumstances.

An increasing population wants a more varied diet, but is trying to grow more food on less land with limited access to water, all the time facing increased costs for fertiliser, and fuel for storage and transport.Even after food is grown, stored and transported, serious losses can occur, and in developing nations where `plentiful? food is wasted. A review of food waste in the US calculated that around 20% of the amount available to consume, was lost from retailing onwards. This translate to 20% of the land, water, labour, seed, pesticide and fertiliser are wasted in the process and thus this is also a financial and environmental loss too.In view of the growing world population and thus a growing demand in food, most of the food produced today is reflective of an unsustainable food system.

The course examines the epistemological issue of orality, culture, and literacy both from the point of view of basic original and theoretical principles established by the best scholars in this discipline (from Milman Parry, to Albert Lord, to Eric Havelock, to Marcel Jousse, to John Foley, to Ruth Finnegan, to Edgard Sienaert), and from the point of view of the direct analysis of examples of oral `unwritten texts? and oral strategies in handing down the traditional knowledge.The teaching activity will be also substantiated by the application of general principles of Theoretical Linguistics and Comparative Literature.

This ideal posits an artist who makes an artwork just to get reactions from its viewers. The reality is a bit more convoluted; an artwork may be used to elicit intangible feelings in the viewer, but it also has a tangible value as a commodity. A painting or a sculpture is often valued in monetary terms; it is traded just like any commodity and changes hands at different prices. This course discusses the different aspects of the global art market that creates and consumes the visual arts by tracking the different pathways an artwork can take from artist-to-owner. From artists who are paid millions for their products to the buyers who speculate in art purely for profit, from auction houses who encourage a laissez-faire attitude to the sale of authentic art to the countless crooks who copy artworks for deceit, the complexities of the visual arts today cannot be understood without us acknowledging that this epitome of `human-ness' is very much a product with a price-tag.Attendance is a requirement as there are continual and formative assessments."}, "AAA08B": {"name": "FASHION & DESIGN: WEARABLE ART AS A SECOND SKIN", "au": "  3.0", "program": "NIE", "mutually_exclusive": null, "not_available_to_program": "ARED, SCED", "not_available_to_program_with": null, "not_available_as_core_to_program": null, "prerequisite": "Students are req to purchase approx $60 of Art materials", "grade_type": null, "description": "Develop process skills in expression and visual articulation through the creation of wearable art works as a second skin.

In a panoramic view, the economy is moving from 'Point-wise'  to 'Network-wise'. Doing business in the Network Economy requires new methods and new business models. But true innovative methods and models can only grow out of new philosophies, thinking, and principles.  This course is explorative in essence. We will first discuss the significant implications of the economic trends and analyze some of the basic economic elements and their relationships from network perspective. We will then lay down a set of principles of the Network Economy. The novel theory, both in micro and macro, can explain, for example, the reasons behind Singapore's economic success. The principles can also guide an enterprise to renovate its business model dynamically to create sustainable values. As one most important takeaway, participants will develop a new model of thinking and a new mindset changing from point-wise thinking to network-wise thinking. The topic on Supply Chain and Logistics Management is discussed in the framework of Network Economy. Supply chain and logistics management deals with the management of flows in a network consisting of suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and customers across all activities such as designing, purchasing, manufacturing, distributing, and customer services. This part covers both strategic and operational issues in supply chain and logistics management. It will introduce key concepts, principles, best practices, innovative ideas, and critical thinking of integrative supply chain and logistics management.
