In fact, much of everyday life is regulated and dictated by environmental law and policy of one kind or another.This course aims to provide students with a good overview of Environmental Sustainability Law and the policies that move the enactment of these laws, regulations, and guidelines. Students will study these issues from an international and national perspective and will have an appreciation of the roles and limitations of the law in resolving these issues.As we all live, work and often play in the built (man-made) environment, this course will devote considerable time examining the way our built environment can be developed to enable a sustainable future.

It focuses on sustainability issues related to the various aspects of business management, such as business policy and strategy design from both an economic and environmental perspective. To provide a good understanding of the business context of sustainability, this first part will begin by exploring its development and regulatory contexts at the global level. It will then be followed by an in-depth examination of the impact of environmental sustainability at industry and firm levels, exploring its influence on industry business practices, corporate strategies and management policies.    The second part, comprising the remaining 6 seminars, discusses some of the contemporary marketing thoughts in environmentalism, social responsibility and marketing ethics. It further examines the issues involved in green marketing mix decision-making and strategy implementation. To achieve this end, students will first be introduced to the various meanings and challenges of Green Marketing. They will then be exposed to existing empirical studies in green consumerism. This will be followed by in-depth discussions of the issues faced by marketers in the design and implementation of the green marketing. For instance, green product issues concerning R&D, packaging, labeling and certification will be examined. Other green marketing mix issues included are greenwashing and green retailing, etc. "}, "AB0502": {"name": "MANAGING SUSTAINABILITY", "au": "  3.0", "program": "ACC", "mutually_exclusive": "AB0001, AB0301, AB0401, AB0402, AB0501, AB0603", "not_available_to_program": "ACBS(GA)-2ndMaj/Spec(AWM) 2, ACBS(GA)-2ndMaj/Spec(AWM) 3, ACBS(GA)-2ndMaj/Spec(BA) 2, ACBS(GA)-2ndMaj/Spec(BA) 3, ACBS(GA)-2ndMaj/Spec(BAF) 2, ACBS(GA)-2ndMaj/Spec(BAF) 3, ACBS(GA)-2ndMaj/Spec(HRC) 2, ACBS(GA)-2ndMaj/Spec(HRC) 3, ACBS(GA)-2ndMaj/Spec(MKG) 2, ACBS(GA)-2ndMaj/Spec(MKG) 3, ACBS(GB)-2ndMaj/Spec(AWM) 2, ACC(2019-onwards), ACC(GA) 2, BCE(2015-onwards), BCG(2015-onwards), BUS 3, BUS(ACS) 2, BUS(AWM) 2, BUS(BA) 2, BUS(BAF) 2, BUS(ITT) 2, BUS(PBL) 2, BUS(RMI) 2", "not_available_to_program_with": null, "not_available_as_core_to_program": null, "not_available_as_UE_to_program": null, "not_available_as_PE_to_program": null, "prerequisite": "Only opened to NBS students.

Its deceptively simple core theme of \"development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs? is now central for business success. Achieving organizational sustainable development and operation involves the engagement with and management of the full range of stakeholders; including customer, shareholder, corporate, community, government and non-government. Geographical dimensions range from local to regional to International. Many organizations now accept sustainability as important to their mission and have strategized for this. Yet outcomes have been mixed, at best. Organizations struggle to align their business and sustainable objectives, something that critics including their customers and NGOs are quick to point out and often do so loudly to corporate detriment. This course focuses on the planning, development and management of sustainability as a central and integral component of successful business outcomes as undertaken in the Asia Pacific region. The course has an applied bias that brings the essence of sustainability theory into practical industry application where the perspectives of the different stakeholders are central to success as a clear understanding of the complexities of Asian contexts. No prior knowledge of the principles or application of sustainability is required, as this course will be delivered accordingly. Participants in this course will address large- and small-scale organizations in a variety of Asian contexts. Ways of thinking about these, the issues involved and the crafting of proactive strategies are relevant to a range of business contexts.

More than ever before, the ability to communicate effectively determines an employee's capacity to thrive in his or her career and to be in demand by employers. Entrepreneurs, alike, must also communicate well in order to articulate and present their ideas to customers, suppliers, the government, and other partners in the business ecosystem.This course is structured to hone students' business communication skills, especially to prevail in an employment situation and to communicate positive-informative messages at work or in business overall. Students will be assessed on their ability to devise clear communication strategies, write effectively, prepare and deliver compelling oral presentations, and share and address feedback.The importance of social media and its profound impact on the way people communicate today will also be explored as will be the most effective manner in which such platforms are harnessed for employees and businesses alike.Specifically, this course aims to develop students' skills in communication management: writing, speaking, listening, and working in teams. The three main objectives of the course are the following:1. Written communication: Students will learn to strategize and organize a positive-informative    message in a professional, high quality business document by effectively adapting to the    contextual requirements and the needs of the given audience.2. Social media communication: Students will explore and critique good practices for personal    and/or company image management to better understand the various risks and opportunities    presented by social media to both individuals and organizations. 3.

The Digital Workflow:Digital technology has become a powerful tool for photographers. Increased flexibility and control of the image-making process, has allowed for greater expressive freedom. The first half of this course introduces you to the digital photographer?s workflow. Through demonstration, instruction and in-class assignments, you will gain an understanding of essential skills, from the capturing of images, to basic photo editing, and to creating archival quality photographic prints. You will have access to Nikon DSLR cameras; software such as Photoshop and Adobe Bridge; and Epson Inkjet printers. What Makes a Good Photograph?An investigation into the elements of a good photograph. Exploring within a single image, the basic concepts of framing, composition, lighting, colour and subject engagement. Through analysis of each other?s prints, you will learn about the importance of colour management and its effect on tonality and colour characteristics. Differences and similarities between Straight Photography and Conceptual Photography will be discussed. Developing a Photographic Series:An in-depth exploration of strategies to develop a photographic series. Different artists and genres of photography will be introduced to help you articulate your own photographic interests. Project development will be guided along through the stages of researching references, planning, execution and review. You will also learn to apply basic concepts of curation with the editing, selection and presentation of images. The Role of the Photographer:Through analysis and discussions of a variety of images, you will be introduced to the semiotics of photography and the role of the photographer in its creation. The photographer as director/art director takes on the responsibility of meaning-making within the frame. Awareness will be brought to the ideas of the preconditioned gaze and the definition of the self in opposition to the other. This will translate to working with subjects and how best to engage and represent them in a photograph. Photography in the Digital Age of Social Media: Digital technology has made the photographic image more ubiquitous than ever. Lectures and discussions will touch upon photographic history and theory, as we try to locate the position of photography as an art form in the age of social media and the proliferation of the everyday image. Attempts will be made as a class to define distinguishing or overlapping traits between fine art and vernacular photography. Class Assignments:- Three creative projects of increasing difficulty help guide you along the process of developing a conceptual photography series. These projects are developed through lectures, tutorials, and instructor and peer feedback sessions. During guided group critiques of projects, you will learn to give structured feedback as you build a visual vocabulary and deepen your understanding of fine art photography. - To inform your own practice, you are to give an artist presentation and to write an exhibition review. This will allow you to research, analyse and present findings on the work of established fine-art photographers and artists who are leading the use of digital imaging.- In-class technical assignments help entrench lessons learnt during lectures and demonstrations.

Asian companies must learn to adapt to the fast-changing rules of global competition, when many of these rules are enacted by the West. The recent sagas against Chinese companies on toys, milk products, textiles and other related products are examples for Asian companies to realize that they cannot operate independently of international opinions, norms, and sensitivities.

The course primarily takes the marketer's perspective, requiring you to consider and critically evaluate factors influencing both the design and implementation of comprehensive, integrated marketing communication (IMC) programs.  In this course, we regard IMC as a system of thinking, processes and coordinated activities driven by the marketer's objectives. Adopting a global perspective, we draw illustrative examples and cases from different parts of the world and discuss issues faced by marketers in conducting IMC programs across countries. The course is designed to develop your logical thinking and creativity regarding IMC.  Although this course is oriented towards practice, we still cover theories and concepts that explain how marketing communication (marcom) practices work and their applicability.  Using these theories and concepts to analyse practices, you will be able to choose and design marcom activities judiciously, justify your choice, and appraise the effectiveness of the activities.Instead of treating IMC as a set of stand-alone tools or activities, the course regards it as a blended mix of coordinated activities.  The course put roughly equal emphasis on both traditional marcom tools (e.g., advertising and sales promotion) and non-traditional tools (e.g., search engine marketing and social media marketing).  The course compares the similarities and differences of these tools, and explains how they can work together for achieving the marketer's objectives.

This course is specially designed to help students understand how humans (consumers, doctors, accountants, policy makers, managers, parents, and students themselves) make -good or bad- decisions. Ever since Daniel Kahneman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002, we have a more accurate understanding of the fact that people do not necessarily obey rational rules in making decisions. This does not mean that decisions are made randomly; on the contrary, an alternate set of rules is at play. Even though the human brain is capable of making millions of calculations per second, it cannot avoid the influences of these biases. Research in cognitive sciences, psychology, behavioural economics and decision neuroscience is guiding us to a fuller understanding of how decisions are made by people. Empowered with this knowledge, you (students) will not only improve your own decision making but also explore ways to design organizations that help people make better decisions. You will learn the decision-making processes and biases that impact choice behaviour. Examples include but not limited to: What are examples of irrational decision making and what are the reasons of this behavior? How do customers make their purchase choices? How do people decide to save (or not)? How do we persuade people to climb the stairs instead of using the elevator? How do our biology and brain influence our decision making? How does the environment influence our behaviour? How does the brain assess risk, trust, time?

Prominent speakers from various Food MNCs, local SMEs, and regulatory bodies (AVA and/or WHO) will be invited to present every week on various topics and food issues. This will also give the students a valuable opportunity to interact personally with food industries and have a deeper understanding of the food policies and issues around the world.This course is aimed to raise awareness among students about real world challenges in food industry around the world and in Singapore. Subjects such as food security, food sustainability and food waste management will be the main focus for every week's seminar.A convergence of factors has made food security one of the most important global issues. An increasing population wants a more varied diet, but is trying to grow more food on less land with limited access to water, all the time facing increased costs for fertiliser, and fuel for storage and transport.Even after food is grown, stored and transported, serious losses can occur, and in developing nations where `plentiful? food is wasted. A review of food waste in the US calculated that around 20% of the amount available to consume, was lost from retailing onwards. This translate to 20% of the land, water, labour, seed, pesticide and fertiliser are wasted in the process and thus this is also a financial and environmental loss too.In view of the growing world population and thus a growing demand in food, most of the food produced today is reflective of an unsustainable food system. This food is dependent on foreign oil, is destroying soil, contaminates water, has caused disease outbreaks, and may be robbing our future generations of the ability to grow food at all."}, "CE1005": {"name": "DIGITAL LOGIC", "au": "  3.0", "program": "CE", "mutually_exclusive": "CE1105, CZ1105", "not_available_to_program": "BCG, CSC, CSEC", "not_available_to_program_with": null, "not_available_as_core_to_program": null, "not_available_as_UE_to_program": "BUS(IT), EEE, EEEC, ENG, ENG(EEE), IEEC, IEM", "not_available_as_PE_to_program": null, "prerequisite": null, "grade_type": null, "description": "Binary variables and logic gates; implementation technologies; combinatorial circuits; binary integers and arithmetic circuits; sequential circuits; simple state machines; digital design using hardware description languages."}, "CE1006": {"name": "COMPUTER ORGANISATION & ARCHITECTURE", "au": "  3.0", "program": "CE", "mutually_exclusive": "CE1106, CZ1106", "not_available_to_program": "BCG, CSC, CSEC, EEE, EEEC, IEEC, IEM", "not_available_to_program_with": null, "not_available_as_core_to_program": null, "not_available_as_UE_to_program": null, "not_available_as_PE_to_program": null, "prerequisite": "CE1005(Corequisite) OR CZ1005(Corequisite)", "grade_type": null, "description": "Computer Hardware Decomposition; Solid-state memory subsystems; Magnetic memory; Input/Output techniques; The central processor unit; How high level code is `executed?; Quantifying and comparing performance;  Computer arithmetic; Towards higher speed."}, "CE1007": {"name": "DATA STRUCTURES", "au": "  3.0", "program": "CE", "mutually_exclusive": "CE1107, CZ1007, CZ1107", "not_available_to_program": "BCE(2020-onwards), BCG, CE(2020-onwards), CEEC(2020-onwards), CSC, CSEC, EEE, EEEC, IEEC, IEM, REP(CE) 2(2019-onwards), REP(CSC)", "not_available_to_program_with": null, "not_available_as_core_to_program": null, "not_available_as_UE_to_program": null, "not_available_as_PE_to_program": null, "prerequisite": "CE1003 OR CZ1003", "grade_type": null, "description": "Syntactic and Semantics of basic constructs in `C' language; Data aggregates; Control Abstraction; Linear Structures; Recursion; Implementing the Tree Abstraction; Example of application-specific structures; Memory management in C; Pointers to functions; Implementing other data abstractions."}, "CE1011": {"name": "ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS I", "au": "  3.0", "program": "CE", "mutually_exclusive": "MH1810", "not_available_to_program": "EEE, ENG, IEM, MATH, PHY", "not_available_to_program_with": null, "not_available_as_core_to_program": null, "not_available_as_UE_to_program": null, "not_available_as_PE_to_program": null, "prerequisite": null, "grade_type": null, "description": "Complex Numbers, Vectors, Matrices, Systems of Linear Equations.

Story depends on solid structuring and the ability to utilise storytelling to awaken the imagination of the buyer, but first and foremost it is about emotion: generating the right degree of emotion and aligning that to company and product branding for given visual media. We therefore need to understand psychology and have real insight into people, not just as a persuasive tool, but a genuine understanding of what people's deepest desires are and how your brand delivers that desire. Having understood the tones, attitudes and empathy generated by your product, we must then structure well. There are two concepts we need to understand to convey this: striking the note of simplicity to engage the emotions and secondly basing those stories on timeless myths and storytelling principles. Having instilled all this, we must then question the nature of advertising as a metacognitive process for the designer of commercials. This provides perspectives on the story being told and why we are compelled to tell it well. By viewing advertising examples from cinema, television and multi-media and investigating the myths and principles that underpin their success, this course reaches deep into the creativity of the student to grow beyond outmoded forms of selling and embrace the future of visual sales-personship.The course therefore generates competency in storytelling for practitioners and researchers in the field of effective advertising.

Burckhardt was writing about Catholic Italy, however, and the individuals this course will examine lived in England, under absolutist Tudor and Stuart monarchs, during a time when the Protestant reformation was giving rise to new democratic ideologies. These writers witnessed the systematic demolition of English Catholicism, and of the feudal society that it entailed, by Henry VIII and his children. The ensuing tension between monarchy and democracy resulted in the English civil war, a conflict which produced, among other things, Milton's epic poem, Paradise Lost. The texts chosen for this course demonstrate that, despite the excitement produced by new discoveries in art, science and geography, the emotion of loss suffuses the literature of the century leading up to the civil war, and this must qualify any notion that the history of the English renaissance is an unambiguous progress-narrative.

It examines how changing politics and events in China influenced Sino-British relations and the British colony during the period from 1945 to 1997, and vice versa. Hong Kong was important geo-politically. Due to geographical proximity, developments in China and Hong Kong always affected each other. The 1967 riots were a classic example. Historically, the legitimacy of British rule was never recognized by the Chinese governments. Tensions always existed between Britain and China over Hong Kong?s future constitutional settlement. Politically, the Chinese Communists and the western governments both treated Hong Kong as a strategic base during the Cold War, advocating competing ideologies. Economically, it served as an economic gateway for the Communist regime to trade with foreign powers and earn foreign exchange. Hong Kong was also unique. Scholars promoted the concept that Hong Kong was a peculiar colony. The colonial government exercised a policy of indirect rule, combining economic laissez-faire with some interventions in for example the provision of social housing. The society underwent rapid urbanization but remained relatively stable. Western and Chinese culture blended. Hong Kong Chinese increasingly differentiated themselves from Mainland Chinese. This module examines the connections between China and British Hong Kong via seven inter-locking themes: changing Sino-British diplomatic relations, imperial diplomacy, colonial state-building, social order, identity, political culture and economic dynamism. Through exploring the modern history of China and British Hong Kong, useful insights in China?s development, international relations and British colonialism can be acquired.

Game theory, besides being of fundamental mathematical interest, is a main tool to model economic and strategic situations and then study the behavior of rational agents in such situations. Mechanism design is the study of how to design games (such as auctions) so that agents have incentive to act in a desirable way, e.g. by telling the truth. This course will improve your ability to model and analyze economics situations in a mathematical way. We will study the way rational agents will play games, based on their assumptions about the rationality of other agents. We will learn about the concept of Nash equilibria, which are solutions to games that no rational agent has an incentive to deviate from, and learn how to compute these. In the second part of the course we turn to the problem of social choice, namely choosing from a set of alternatives, given the preferences of a set of players. We will see that many desirable properties of social choice functions cannot be satisfied, and then turn to ways to deal with this issue. The first way is to introduce payments and money-valued preferences, which leads to auction theory and related topics. Here students will learn how to design auctions and other economic mechanisms so that players have no incentive to lie, and to learn how to compute expected revenues. Secondly, we will consider mechanisms that do not allow payments, and study the ways manipulations by the players can be limited in this case. In the second part of the course students will learn how to design economic mechanisms that have certain properties (if possible), and how to judge economic mechanisms, as well as to apply Bayesian reasoning to compute expected outcomes.The course is aimed at 3rd and 4th year students interested in economics, mathematical modelling, and applied math in general."}, "MH4510": {"name": "STATISTICAL LEARNING & DATA MINING", "au": "  4.0", "program": "MATH(SPS)", "mutually_exclusive": "CZ4041", "not_available_to_program": "EEE, EEEC, IEEC, IEM", "not_available_to_program_with": null, "not_available_as_core_to_program": null, "not_available_as_UE_to_program": null, "not_available_as_PE_to_program": null, "prerequisite": "MH2500 & MH3500 & MH3510 & MH3511", "grade_type": null, "description": "This course gives an overall view of the modern statistical/machine learning techniques for mining massive datasets, ranging from generalized linear models, over model selection, to the state-of-the-art techniques like LASSO, neural networks, etc. This course will not only discuss individual algorithms and methods, but also tie principles and approaches together from a theoretical perspective.

Module 1 introduces what is Systems Thinking and how does it relate to Systems Engineering.  Systems Thinking is a dialectical way of thinking that relates real-world needs and problems to idealized conceptual models in order to explore and develop viable solutions. A systemic approach is adopted that emphasizes both logic and culture, as in human behaviour, in problem solving. It recognises that the world is a set of highly interconnected technical and social entities which are hierarchically organised producing emergent properties.  Systems Thinking is an essential skill for Systems Engineers which is shared with many disciplines and provides a key intellectual underpinning for Systems Engineering and program management.Module 2 provides first a conceptual-level description of Systems Engineering discipline. It then follows up with application aspects of the systems engineering processes and practices that relate to the life cycle development and management of an engineered system.  The course aims to provide an overview of how a quality engineered system is developed based broadly on an extended life-cycle model from defining a business case, addressing stakeholders? needs and requirements, developing systems requirements, functional and physical architecture, to systems design and build, systems integration and verification, and final validation and acceptance.  This course also gives emphasis to the interdependency between Systems Engineering and Program Management, with both disciplines enabled by Systems Thinking and methodologies. Teaching cases will be used to illustrate the economic, technical and programmatic benefits of applying systems thinking and systems engineering practices in the planning, development and deployment of complex products and systems.  A special topic will be introduced to gain an appreciation of the strategy and architecture of Industry 4.0. A system of systems perspective will be encouraged to gain additional insights of this 4th Industrial Revolution and how it will shape the future of manufacturing."}, "MT1001": {"name": "MATHEMATICS I FOR MARITIME STUDIES", "au": "  3.0", "program": "MS(CEE)", "mutually_exclusive": "MT1101", "not_available_to_program": "MAT", "not_available_to_program_with": null, "not_available_as_core_to_program": null, "not_available_as_UE_to_program": null, "not_available_as_PE_to_program": null, "prerequisite": null, "grade_type": null, "description": "Function and graph.

The rotational symmetry in Hydrogenic atoms will also be discussed, which will also introduce you to 3D QM. Part 3 adds on to the formalism for systems that cannot be solved exactly.

However, East Asia currently faces many security challenges, including strategic uncertainty about the rise of China and US commitment to the region; regional territorial disputes, such as East and South China Sea, the Northern Territories, Takeshima/Dokto, India-China border disputes; Japan?s historical controversies with China and South Korea; North Korea's nuclear and missile development; and the Taiwan political problem. Here, the important question is how to maintain regional stability and ensure the mid- and long-term security in East Asia to realize a true 'Asian Century.'This course provides the student in-depth knowledge about the security development in East Asia from the post-World War II period as well as theoretical perspectives to capture the main components of East Asian Security mechanism.

With the deluge of information about the woes and potentialities of cities for human futures, this course aims to take a reflective stance and ask as Lewis Mumford once did, 'What is a City?' with the goal to gain clarity about the concept, purpose and the nuts and bolts of a city as a human environment.This course draws upon selected readings in classic and modern philosophy about what a good city is. Even though these philosophical readings discussed cities in the classical and early modern times, they touched upon many dimensions and challenging issues of contemporary cities including size, class, inequality, diversity, justice and their relationship with the urban built environment. These topics are intended to form the content of the course for the subsequent weeks. Whenever available and appropriate, policy reports from international organizations like the United Nations will be included in the topical discussion throughout the semester to make explicit the nexus between theory and practice that lies at the crux of most urban research.

In addition to foundational themes in human geography and their implications for urban planning, we will also cover some of the most pressing socio-spatial issues in our world today. These topics will draw out the wide-ranging local-global connections in the fields of social, cultural, urban, political and economic geography. We will draw upon case studies from Singapore and around the world to provide empirical contexts to the concepts discussed in lectures.  Through the interdisciplinary lens of human geography and urban planning, these contextual examples will reflect the diverse place-based practices, processes, problems and possibilities of life in contemporary societies.
